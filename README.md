# ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project provides a *Machine Learning based Crop Recommendation System* that suggests the most suitable crop for cultivation given soil and environmental conditions.  
It supports *sustainable agriculture* by enabling data-driven decisions for better yield and optimized resource use.
